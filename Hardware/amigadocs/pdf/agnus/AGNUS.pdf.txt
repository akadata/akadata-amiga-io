     1.0 DESCRIPTION

      This specification describes the requirements for an N-channel HMOS DMA Controller. The IC device described
      herein shall produce, in a 68000 microprocessor environment, DMA addresses using a RAM Address Generator and
      a Register Address Encoder. This device shall contain 25 DMA channel controllers that include the Blitter, Bitplane,
      Copper, Audio, Sprites, Disk and Memory Refresh.

      The IC shall generate 7 MHz and 3.5 MHz system clocks, dynamic RAM interface to address up to one or two mega-
      bytes of memory (depending on bonding option), and NTSC/PAL video synchronization pulses. These pulses are
      also completely programmable to interface to higher resolution monitors. The timings are based on a clock input of
      28.63636 MHz for NTSC mode and 28.375 MHz for PAL mode.

       A20, A19-Al    35, 59 thru 77   IN          Address bus Al to A8 are used by the processor to
                                                   select the internal registers and put an address code on
                                                   the RGA lines to select registers outside the device.
                                                   The processor uses Al to A20 to generate multiplexed
                                                   DRAM addresses on the MA outputs. The A19 line is also
                                                   used to indicate which RAS line is activated. If A19 is
                                                   high RASl* is asserted; if low, RAS0* is asserted.

       RDl5-RD0       1 thru 14        I/O         This data bus is buffered and is used by and 83 & 84
                      83 & 84                      the processor to access the device registers. The data
                                                   bus is also accessed during DMA operations.

       AS*            24               IN          Active low. This input is the processor address strobe
                                                   signal. When asserted, it indicates that the address lines
                                                   (Al to A20) are valid.



       RGEN*          23               IN          Active low. When this signal is asserted along with AS*,
                                                   the processor uses Al to A8 to access one of the device
                                                   registers or put a value on the RGA outputs to select
                                                   registers outside the device.



       RAMEN*         25               IN          Active low. When this signal is asserted together with
                                                   AS*, the processor is doing a DRAM access. The
                                                   processor supplies an address on the Al to A20 inputs
                                                   and the device multiplexes this address onto the MA
                                                   outputs during the same cycle, the processor also controls the
                                                   A19 line to select one of the RAS0* or RAS1*.

       PRW            22               IN          This signal defines the data bus transfer as a read or
                                                   write cycle to memory. The signal is only enabled when
                                                   the processor is undergoing a DRAM access. A low on
                                                   this signal signifies a processor write cycle to memory;
                                                   a high indicates a processor read cycle from memory.

       RRW            21               OUT         The device controls this signal to indicate either a DMA
                                                   or processor DRAM read/write access. In both
                                                   cases, a low on this line indicates a write operation and
                                                   a high indicates a read operation.

           MA0-MA8,      42 thru 50, 55     OUT         Output bus. This 10 bit output bus provides multiplexed
           MA9                                          addresses to DRAMs. This bus operates in two cycles.
                                                        The first cycle provides the DRAMs with the row

       4.0 MODES OF OPERATION

       This device is an address generator type IC. Its main function is as a RAM address generator and register address encoder
       that shall produce all DMA addresses for 25 channels.

       The block diagram (figure 2) for this device shows the DMA control and address bus logic. The output of each controller
       indicates the number of DMA channels driving the Register Address Encoder and RAM Address Generator.

       The RAM Address Generator contains an 18 bit pointer register for each of the 25 DMA channels and also it contains
       pointer restart (backup) registers and jump registers for six (6) of the channels. A full 18 bit adder carries out the pointer
       increments and adds for jumps.

       The priority control logic looks at the pipe-lined DMA request from each controller and stages the DMA cycles based
       upon their programmed priority and sync counter time slot. Then it signals the processor to get off the bus by asserting the
       DBR line. The following is a brief description of the device’s major operational modes.

       The procedure for moving and combining bit mapped images in memory received the name Bit Blit from the computer in-
       struction that did block transfer of data on bit boundries. The routines became known as Bit Blitters or Blitters. The Blit-
       ter DMA controller is preloaded with the address and size of 3 source images (A, B, and C) and one (1) destination (D) in
       the dynamic RAM (Refer to Figure 4). These images can be as small as a single character or as large as twice the screen
       size. They can be full images or smaller windows of a larger image. After one word of each source image is sequentially
       loaded into the source buffer (A, B, C) they are shifted and then combined together in the logic unit to perform image
       movement overlay, masking, and replacements. The result is captured in the destination buffer (D) and sent back to the
       RAM memory destination address.

       This operation is repeated until the complete image has been processed. The unit has extensive pipelining to allow for
       shifter and logic unit propagation time, while the next set of source words is being fetched.

       A control register deterines which of 256 possible logic operations is to be performed as the source images are combined
       and how far they are to be moved (Barrel shifted). In addition to the image combining and movement powers, the Blitter
       can be programmed to do line drawing or area fill between lines.

   4.3 BITPLANE ADDRESSING

       Some computer bitmap displays are organized so that the bitplanes for each pixel are all located within the same address.
       This is called pixel addressing. If the entire data word of one address is used for a single pixel with 8 bit planes, the data
       word will look like this. (numbers are bitplanes) :

       12345678--------

       The data compression can be improved by packing more than one pixel into a single address like this:

       1234567812345678

       or like this, if there are only 4 bitplanes:

       1234123412341234

       The IC device uses a bitmap technique called Bitplane Addressing. This separates the bitplanes in memory. To create a 4
       plane (16 color) image, the bitplane display DMA channels fetch from 4 separate areas of memory like this:
       1111111111111111
       2222222222222222
       3333333333333333
       4444444444444444

       These are held in buffer registers and are used together as pixels, one bit at a time, by the display (left to right).

       This technique allows reduced odd numbers of bitplanes (such as 3 or 5) while maintaining packing efficiency and speed. It
       also allows grouping bitplanes into 2 separate images, each with independent hardware high speed image manipulation, line
       draw, and area fill.

   4.4 DMA CHANNEL FUNCTIONS

       Each channel has an 18 bit RAM address pointer that is placed on the MA memory address bus, and is used to select the lo-
       cation of the DMA data transfer from anywhere in 1M words (2M bytes) of RAM.

       An eight (8) bit destination address is simultaneously placed on the register address bus (RGA), sending the data to the cor-
       responding register.

       Figure l0 shows a typical DMA channel and almost all channels have DRAM as source and chip registers as destination.

       The pointer must be preloaded and is automatically incremented each time a data transfer occurs.

       Each controller utilizes one or more of these DMA channels for its own purposes. The following is a brief summary of
       these controllers and the DMA channels they use.




                                                                               TITLE

           Refer to Appendix A of this specification for raster line time allocation for each of these DMA channels.

           A-Blitter (four (4) Channels)

           The Blitter uses four (4) DMA channels, Three source and one (1) destination as previously described.

           Once the Blitter has been started, the four (4) DMA channels are synchronized and pipelined to automatically handle
           the data transfers without further processor intervention. The images are manipulated in memory, independent of the
           the display (bitplane DMA).

           B-Bitplane (six (6) channels)

           The bitplane controller continuously (during display) transfers display data from memory to display buffer registers.
           There are six (6) DMA channels to handle the data from six (6) independent bit planes. The buffers convert this bit-
           plane dat into pixel data for the display.

           C-Copper (one (1) Channel)

           The Copper is a co-processor that uses one of the DMA channels to fetch its instructions. The DMA pointer is the in-
           struction counter and must be preloaded with the starting address of the Copper’s instructions.

           The Copper can move (write) data into chip registers. It can skip, jump, and wait (halt). These simple instructions
           give great power and flexibility because of the following features.

           When Copper is halted, it is off the data bus, using no bus cycles until the wait is over. The programmed wait value
           is compared to a counter that keeps track of the TV beam position (beam counter) and when they are equal, the Cop-
           per will resume fetching instructions.

           It can cause interrupts, reload the color registers, start the Blitter or service the audio. It can modify almost any regis-
           ter inside or outside the IC device, based on the TV screen coordinates given by the Beam Counter and the actual ad-
           dress encoded on the RGA Bus.

           D-Audio (four (4) Channels)

           There are four (4) audio channels, all of which are located outside of the DMA Controller IC. Each controller is in-
           dependent and uses one DMA channel from the DMA Controller IC and fetches its data during a dedicated timing
           slot within horizontal blanking. This is accomplished by a controller asserting the DMAL input on the DMA Con-
           troller.

           E-Sprites (eight (8) channels)

           There are eight (8) independent Sprite controllers, each with its own DMA channel and its own dedicated time slot
           for DMA data transfer. Sprites are line buffered objects that can move very fast because their positions are control-
           led hardware registers and comparators.

           Each sprite has two (2) sixteen bit data registers that define a 16 pixel wide Sprite with 4 colors. Each has a horizon-
           tal position register, a vertical start position register and a vertical stop position register. This allows variable verti-
           cal size sprites.

           The Sprite DMA controller fetches image and position data automatically from anywhere in 512K of memory.

           Sprites can be run automatically in DMA mode or they can be loaded and controlled by the microprocessor.

           Each Sprite can be re-used vertically as often as desired. Horizontal re-using is also allowed with micoprocessor con-
           trol.

           F-Disk (one (1) channel)

           The disk controller, which is located outside of the DMA, uses a single DMA channel from the device. The control-
           ler uses the DMA time slot for data transfer and can read or write a block of data up to 128K anywhere in 512K of
           memory.

           G-Memory Refresh (One (1) Channel)

           The refresh controller uses a single DMA channel with its own time slots. It places RAS addresses on the memory ad-
           dress bus (MA) during these slots, in order to refresh the dynamic RAM. Memory is refreshed on every raster line.

           During the DMA no data transfer actually takes place. The register address bus (RGA) is used to supply video syn-
           chronizing codes. At this time RAS1* and RAS are low. CASU* and CASL* are inactive during this cycle.

           RAM AND REGISTER ADDRESSING

           The device generates RAM addresses from two sources, the processor or from the device performing DMA cycles se-
           lected by a multiplexer. This multiplexer allows the processor to access RAM when AS* and RAMEN* are both
           low. At this time, the device also multiplexes the processor address (Al-A20) onto the MA bus. During row address
           time A1-A8, A17 and A19 are placed on MA0 to MA7, MA8, MA9, respectively. During the column address time
           A9-A16, A18 and A20 are placed on MA0 to MA7, MA8, MA9, respectively. A19 is also used to determine the
           RAS line to be asserted. If A19 is low RAS0* is active and if high RAS1* is active. The IC will assert CASL* if
           LDS* is low or CASU* if UDS* is low.

           When the device needs to do a DMA cycle, the multiplexer disables the processor from accessing RAM by asserting
           the Data Bus Request Line (DBR*). At this time, the device multiplexes its generated RAM address onto the MA
           lines and will activate RAS and the proper RAS0* or RAS1* line unless it is a refresh cycle where all RAS lines are
           active. During a DMA cycle, the IC device will also assert both CASU* and CASL*, unless it is a refresh cycle
           where they both remain inactive.

           The device also generates RGA addresses from either the processor or device DMAs, each of which is selected by an-
           other internal multiplexer. This multiplexer allows the processor to perform a register read/write access when AS*
           and RGEN* are both low. The device then takes the low order byte of the processor address Al to A8 and reflects its
           value on the RGA output bus RGAl to RGA8. The device will reflect the status of PRW input on the RRW output
           line, to indicate a memory read or write operation.

           During a device DMA cycle, the multiplexer prevents the processor from doing a register access by asserting the
           DBR* line. The device will then place the contents of its register address encoder onto the RGA bus.

           5.0 REGISTER DESCRIPTION

           This DMA controller device contains 125 registers that can be accessed after the following conditions have been met.
           The state of AS* and RGEN* must be an active low level and the least 8 significant address bits (Al thru A8) must
           contain the valid address of the register to be accessed. Refer to Table 2 for complete list of register addresses and
           type.

       HARDDIS This bit is used to disable the hardware vertical and horizontal window limits. This bit is cleared upon RESET.

       LPENDIS When this bit is a logical 0 and lpe is enabled, the light pen latched value (hit location) will be read by
       VHPOSR, VPOSR and HHPOSR. When the bit is a logical 1 the light pen latched value is bypassed and the actual beam
       counter positon is read by VHPOSR, VPOSR and HHPOSR.

       VARVBEN Use the comparator generated Vertical Blank (from VBSTART, VBSTOP) to run the internal chip stuff send-
       ing RGA signals to DENISE, starting Sprites, resetting light pen. It also disables the hard stop on the display window.

       LOLDIS Disable long line/short line toggle. This is useful for dual mode where even multiples are wanted, or in any sin-
       gle display where toggling is not desired.

       CSCBEN The variable composite sync comes out on the HSY* pin, and the variable composite blank comes out on the
       VSY* pin. The idea is to allow all the information to come out of the chip for dual mode display. The normal monitor
       uses the normal composite sync, and the variable composite sync and blank come out of the HSY* and VSY* pins. The
       bits VARVSYEN and VARHSYEN have priority over this control bit.

           VARVSYN Comparator for VSY -> VSY* pin. The variable VSY is set vertically on VSSTRT, reset vertically on
           VSSTOP, with the horizontal position for set and reset HSTRT on short fields (all field are short if LACE =1) and
           HCENTER on long fields (every other field if LACE = 1)

           VARHSYN Comparator HSY -> HSY* pin. Set on HSSTRT value, reset on HSSTOP value.

           VARBEAMEN Enables the variable beam counter comparators to operate (allowing different beam counter total val-
           ues) on the main horizontal counter. It also disables hard display stops both horizontal and vertical.

           DUAL Runs the horizontal comparators with the alternate horizontal beam counter, and starts the UHRES pointer
           chain with the reset of this counter rather than the normal one. This allows the UHRES pointer to come out more than
           once in a horizontal line, assuming there is some memory bandwidth left (it doesn’t work in 640 x 400 x 4 interlace
           mode). Also, to keep the two displays synched, the horizontal line lengths should be multiples of each other. If you
           are clever, you might not need to do this.

           PAL Set the appropriate decodes (in normal mode) for PAL. In variable beam counter mode this bit disables the
           long/short line toggle (sets all lines short).

           VARCSYEN Enable CSY* from the variable decoders to come out the CSY* pin (VARCSY is set on HSSTRT
           match always and also on HCENTER match when in vertical sync). It is reset on HSSTOP match when VSY* and on
           both HBSTRT and HBSTOP matches during VSY. A reasonable composite can be generated by setting HCENTER
           half a horizontal line from HSSTRT, and HSSTOP at (HSTOP-HSTRT) before HSSTRT.

           BLANKEN Enables CB* (composite blank) to come out the CSY* pin. HB or VB that are generated from compara-
           tors. If neither BLANKEN or VARCSYEN are high, the normal CSY* from the regular decode comes out. This may
           be rather strange in variable beam modes, as some of the fixed decodes may not happen.

           HSYTRUE, VSYTRUE, CSYTRUE These change the polarity of the HYS*, VSY*, and CSY* pin respectivly for in-
           put and output.

           BLT x PTL                  Blitter pointer to x (low 15 bits)

           This pair of registers contains the 20 bit address of the Blitter source (x =a,b,c) or destination (x=D) DMA data. This
           pointer must be preloaded with the starting address of the data to be processed by the blitter. After the Blitter is fin-
           ished it will contain the last data address (plus increment and modulo).

           LINE DRAW                BLTAPTL is used as an accumulator register and must be preloaded with the starting value
           of (2Y-X) where Y/X is the line slope. BLTDPT and BLTCPT (both high and low) must be preloaded with the start-
           ing address of the line.

           BLT x MOD                  Blitter modulo

           This register contains the modulo for the blitter source ( X= A,B,C) or the destination ((X = D). A modulo is a number
           that is automatically added to the address, then points to the start of the next line. Each source or destination has its

           LINE DRAW: BLTAMOD and BLTBMOD are used as slope storage registers and must be preloaded with the values
           (4Y-4X) and (4Y) respectively. Y/X = line slope BLTCMOD and BLTDMOD must both be preloaded with the width
           (in bytes) of the image into which the line is being drawn (normally 2 times the screen width).

           BLTALWM                    Blitter last word mask for Source A

           The patterns in these two registers are "anded" with the first and last words of each line of data from Source A into the
           Blitter. A zero in any bit overrides data from source A. These registers should set to all "ones" for fill mode or for line
           drawing mode.

           This register holds Source x (x=A,B,C) data for use by the Blitter. It is normally loaded by the Blitter DMA channel,
           however, it may also be preloaded by the microprocessor.

           LINE DRAW BLTADAT is used as an index register and must be preloaded with 8000.
           is used for texture. It must be preloaded with FF if no texture (solid line) is desired.

           This register holds the data resulting from each word of Blitter operation until it is sent to a RAM destination. This is a
           dummy address and cannot be read by the micro. The transfer is automatic during Blitter operation.

       BPLxPTL                    Bit plane x pointer (low 15 bits)

       These are the blitter size registers for blits larger than the earlier chips could accept. The original commands are retained
       for compatability. BLTSIZV should be written first, followed by BLTSIZH, which starts the blitter. BLTSIZV need not
       be rewritten for subsequent blits if the vertical size is the same. The maximum size of a blit is 32K pixels * 32K lines.
       All don’t cares (x’s) should be written to 0’s for upward compatability.

       BPLHDAT H 07A W A ext logic UHRES bit plane pointer identifier

       BPLHMOD H 1E6 W A UHRES bit plane modulo. This is the number (sign extended) that is
       addedd to the UHRES bit plane pointer (BPLHPTL,H) every line, and then another 2 is added, just like the other modu-
       los.

       BPLHPTH H 1EC W A UHRES (VRAM) bit plane pointer (high 5 bits)
       BPLHPTL H 1EE W A UHRES (VRAM) bit plane pointer (low 15 bits)
       When UHRES is enabled, this pointer comes out on the second ’free’ cycle after the start of each horizontal line. Its
       modulo is added every time it comes out. ’Free’ means priority above COPPER and below the fixed stuff (audio,
       sprites...). BPLHDAT comes out as an identifier on the RGA lines when the pointer address is valid so that external de-
       tectors can use this to do special cycles for the VRAMs. The SHRHDAT get the first and third free cycles.

       BPLHSTOP H 1D6 W A UHRES bit plane vertial stop
       This controls the line when the data fetch stops for the BPLHPTH,L pointers. V10-V0 on DB10-0


       BPLHSTRT H 1D4 W A UHRES bit plane pointer vertical stop.
       This controls the line when the data fetch starts for the BPLHPTH,L pointers. V10-V0 on DB10-DB0.

       BPL x PTL                  Bit plane pointer (low 15 bits)

       This pair of registers contains the 18 bit pointer to the address of Bit plane x (x=l,2,3,4,5,6) DMA data. This pointer
       must be reinitialized by the processor or Copper to point to the beginning of Bit Plane data every vertical blank time.

       BPL2MOD                    Bit plane modulo (even plane)

       These registers contain the modulos for the odd and even bit planes. A modulo is a number that is automatically added to
       the address at the end of each line, so that the address points to the start of the next line. Since they have seperate modu-
       los, the odd and even bit planes may have size that are different from each other, as well as different from the display
       widow size.

        * NOTE: BFD Blitter finished disable. When this bit is true, the Blitter Finished flag will have no effect on the Cop-
       per. When this bit is zero the Blitter Finished flag must be true (in addition to the rest of the bit comparisons), from its
       wait state, or skip before the Copper can exit from its wait state, or skip over an instruction. Note that the V7 compari-
       son cannot be masked.

       The Copper is basically a 2 cycle machine that requests the bus only during odd memory cycles (4 memory cycles per
       in). This prevents collisions with Display, Audio, Disk, Refresh, and Sprites, all of which use only even cycles. It
       therefore needs (and has) priority over only the Blitter and Micro.

       There are only three types of instructions: MOVE immediate, WAIT until, and SKIP if. All instructions (except
       WAIT) require 2 bus cycles (and two instruction words). Since only odd bus cycles are requested, 4 memory cycle
       times are required per instruction (memory cycles are 280 nS).

       There are two indirect jump registers COP1LC and COP2LC. These are 20 bit pointer registers whose contents are used
       to modify the program counter for initialization or jumps. They are transfered to the program counter whenever strobe
       addresses COPJMP1 or COPJMP2 are written. In addition COP1LC is automatically used at the beginning of each verti-
       cal blank time.

       It is important that one of the jump registers be initialized and its jump strobe address hit, after power up but before Cop-
       per DMA is initialized. This insures a determined startup address and state.

       DIWSTRT                    Display window start (upper left vertical-horizontal positon)
       DIWSTOP                    Display window stop (lower right vertical-horizontal position)

       These registers control the Display window size and position, by locating the upper left and lower right corners.

       DIWSTOP is vertically restricted to the lower 1/2 of the display (V8=/=V7), and horizontally restricted to the right 1/4
       of the display (H8=1).

       DIWSTRT is vertically restricted to the upper 2/3 of the display (V8=0), and horizontally restricted to the left 3/4 of the
       display (H8=0).

       DIWHIGH H                  Display window upper bits for start, stop.

       This is an added register for the hires chips, and allows larger start and stop ranges. If it is not written, the above
       (DIWSTRT, STOP description holds. If this register is written last in a sequence of setting the display widow, it sets di-
       rect start and stop positions anywhere on the screen. It does not affect the UHRES pointers.

       These registers control the horizontal timing of the beginning and end of the Bit Plane DMA display data fetch. The
       vertical Bit Plan DMA timing is identical to the Display windows described above. The Bit Plane Modulos are depend-
       ent on the Bit Plane horizontal size, and on this data fetch window size.
