  2.0 SYSTEM ROM

  The onboard ROMs are selected in the address range from $OASOOOO to $OB7FFFF, $OEOOOOO to
  $OE7FFFF, and $OFSOOOO to $OFFFFFF. The ROMs are also selected in the range from
  $0000000 to $OlFFFFF when the internal overlay signal (OVL) is high (this allows the RESET
  vectors to be contained in the ROMs). The internal OVL signal becomes asserted at reset, and
  negates on the first write to CIA1 (address range of $BFDOOO to $BFDFFF.

  2.1 ROM Timing

  ROM timing is shown below:

   3.0 FLASH ROM

  There is provision for an optional flash ROM device. The intent is that this is a possible
  replacement for a floppy disk drive in an extremely low end variant of the A300. The enable for
  the flash rom is called -FLASH-CE, and is active in the address range from $OAOOOOO to
  $OA7FFFF. This output is enabled when the proper data strobe is asserted, and the address is in
  range. Generation of -DTACK is identical to that for system ROa accesses.


   3.0 CHIP RAM

   Chip RAM cycles are generated during accesses to locations $0000000 to $0200000. When the
   internal OVL signal is asserted, ROM appears in this space instead of chip RAlM (see section on
   ROM for further information on OVL).

   3.1 Chip RAM Timing

   Timing for chip RAM cycles is given in the timing section of the Chip Register discussion
   (section 4.1). All timings given are equally valid for either chip registers or chip RAM.

   4.0 CHIP REGISTERS

   The chip registers are selected in the range from $ODFFOOO to $ODFFlFF. Chip registers show
   up in user and supervisor data space.

   4.1 Chip RAM and Register Timing

   Timing is given on the following page. Note that timimng for chip RAM accesses is identical. A
   wait state is inserted when the access is from a DMA device.

   5.0 CIA’

   The 8520 CIA’s are selected in the address range from $OBFOOOO to $OBFFFFF. ODD-CIA
   responds to addresses in this range in which address line 12 is low, with data appearing at odd
   addresses. The standard location to use in accesssing ODD-CIA is from $OBFEOOO to
   $OBFEFFF. EVEN-CIA responds to addresses from $OBFOOOO to $OBFFFFF in which address
   line 13 is low, with data appearing at even addresses. The standard location to use for accessing
   this CIA is from $OBFDOOO to $OBFDFFF.

   5.1 CIA timing

  GAYLE provides synchronization of the processor to CIA accesses as well as generation of the E
  clock signal. Timing is shown below:

   6.0 REAL-TIME CLOCK

   The real-time clock (RTC) is selected in the address range from $ODCOOOO to $ODCFFF. The
   RTC appears in both user and supervisor spaces.

   6.1 RTC Timing

   The real-time clock timing is based on the Ricoh RP5COl real-time clock chip. GAYLE’s timing
   to the RTC is shown below:

   7.0 IDE HARD DRIVE

   The IDE (AT) hard drive requires two mutually exclusive chip selects. Please see the chart
   below for address range in which each is active. The -1OW and -1OR signals have timing that is
   valid for IDE hard drives during these cycles.

   Data register accesses CZ.P be performed faster than control register accesses. Accesses to the
   control registers are 1;dlled “8 bit accesses” while those to the data register are called “16 bit
   accesses”. Show: oelow is a table that gives the chip select and access speed versus address
   range.

   10.0 SYSTEM RESET LOGIC

   The -KBRESET input drives the open collector outputs RESET an d -HALT low. No matter
   how short the pulse, GAYLE stretches the RESET and -HALT outputs to at least 560ns. When
   -RESETis driven low (either by GAYLE or externally), all internal states in GAYLE are reset,
   including the registers, which are all set to ‘0’.

   The system clocks expected by ANIMAL are shown below. Note that C3 is generated internally.

   12.0 FLOPPY GLUE

   The floppy signals MTRON, MTRX, DKWDB, and DKWEB are generated by GAYLE. All of
   these signals are open collector outputs.

   MTRON is the signal that tells the floppy motor to turn on. It is the -MTR input latched by the
   -SEL input. MTRON is guaranteed negated when RESET is asserted.

   MTRX is the signal that tells the floppy motor to do what, George? It follows the _ MTR input
   except during reset when it is guaranteed negated.

   DKWDB is a buffered version of the -DKWD signal.

   DKWEB follows DKWE, except it is negated during reset.


   13.0 BUFFER CONTROL

   SHould this be folded in with other sections, or is there something special to say, George?


   14.0 DTACK GENERATION

   Automatic generation of the 68000 cycle termination signal, DTACK, is provided. GAYLE
   decodes addresses to determine timing for the DTACK signal. Timing for DTACK is given in
   many of the individual sections of this specification, but for any address ranges not covered in
   other sections (such as expansion space), DTACK works as follows:

         1. If -0VR or XRDY are not asserted, DTACK is generated at the beginning of S4,
   guaranteeing a 4 clock cycle.
        2. When -0VR is asserted, the -DTACK output is tristated, allowing the device that
   asserted -0VR to generate its own -DTACK.
        3. If XRDY is asserted in time, generation of -DTACK is held off until XRDY is negated.

   14.1 DTACK Timing

   Timing for DTACK is shown below:
GAYLE Specification                            July 10, 1991                              Page 10 of 17
                                      DTACK Timing




   15.0 OVR AND XRDY SIGNALS

   In addition to its function in overriding the generation of -DTACK, the -0VR signal can
   override address decoding in GAYLE. Thus it can be used to allow external devices to reside in
   address ranges that are normally reserved for motherboard devices, such as the credit card
   interface. Use of -0VR for this use basically requires that -0VR is asserted earlier than -AS.
   Address ranges where this is effective are shown below:

            Address range              Normal cvcle tvDe                 Cycle type with OVR

            $FSOOOO -$FFFFFF           System      ROM     .                     zorro II
   Any address ranges where -0VR is legal, use of the XRDY signal to extend the cycle is also
   legal. Other address ranges ignore the XRDY signal.



   16.0 CREDIT CARD INTERFACE

   GAYLE includes a complete interface to the industry standard PCMCIA cartridge. Limited
   support of hot insertion and removal is included. GAYLE supports three different kinds of credit
   card cycles:

            - Credit card memory cycles
            - Credit card attribute memory cycles
            - Credit card I/O cycles


GAYLE Specification                          July 10, 1991                             Page 11 of 17
    16.1 Credit card memory cycles

   These cycles are active during accesses of address $4000’00 to $8FFFFF while a credit card is
   inserted. Accesses from $400000 to $7FFFFF are to the credit card main memory. Accesses
   from $8000000 to $8FFFFF are to credit card attribute memory. Both types of cycles are
   identical, except credit card attribute cycles assert -CC-REG and -CC-ENA, while main
   memory cycles just assert -CC-EINA. This represents 4 MB of directly accessable main memory
   address space. The full 64MB of defined address space may be reached using the page registers
   in GAYLE. Currently GAYLE does not actually support
                                                     -^   these, but future versions may very well
   do so.

   16.3 Credit card I/O cycles

   Credit card I/O cycles occur during accesses to $900000 to $9FFFFF while a credit card is
   inserted.

   16.4 Credit card I/O timing

   Timing for credit card I/O cycles is shown below:

   17.0 Test Mode

   If -0VR is asserted at the rising edge of -KBRESET, a test mode is entered in which the E clock
   state counters reset to a known condition.


   18.0 SPARE chip select

   A spare chip select is provided. It is asserted on any access to locations $DSOOOO to $D8FFFFF.
   Timing is similar to the ARCNET chip select.


   19.0 GAYLE Registers

   Four registers are included that facilitate support of the cartridge slot and IDE interrupt
   management. All registers are set to zero at reset time. These registers are shown on the
   following two pages:

   Bit 8:          Allows the software to disable the credit card interface altogether. Writing a value of ‘1’ disables
                   the credit card interface, ‘0’ allows it to become enabled (having no credit card installed also
                   disables the interface. Disabling the credit card interface includes disabling address decoding for
                   the credit card areas, makes the credit card inputs appear to be in the inactive state, and inhibits
                   status change interrupts.
   Bit 9:          Enable for the credit card digital audio output. Writing a ’ 1’ enables connecting the credit card
                   digital audio to the amiga audio and disables the BVD2 input to the interrupt request logic.
   Bits 10-15:     Each represent an external line. Reading any of these allows the software to determine the current
                   state of the specified line. Writing a value of 1 to any of these bits allows the software to force
                   GAYLE to behave as if the specified line is asserted (including returning a ‘1’ when this register is
                   read). If the credit card is not inserted, or if the CC disable bit is asserted, the credit card lines will
   all appear to be negated, although any lines that the software has written a ‘1’ to will still read          back as a
   ’ 1’. The external lines are as follows:
                   IDE int         Interrupt output of the IDE drive; this bit is high whenever the IDE drive is

                   WR enable       Write enable; this bit is high when the credit card is write enabled. When low writes
                                   are inhibited.

   Bit 8:          Allows the software to tell GAYLE to generate a reset whenever the credit card detect status line
                   has changed (i.e. the credit card has been inserted/removed).
   Bit 9:          Causes a bus error to be generated on any access to the credit card area after the credit card detect
                   status line has changed.
   Bits 10-15:     Are the same signals as at address SDA8000, but the register at SDAAOOO tells you when any of
                   these bits has changed value. The bit remains high (and the interrupt line remains active) until a ‘0’
                   is written to that bit. Writing a ‘1’ will cause a bit to be unchanged.

                 card reset signal. Note: Credit card not inserted or disabled forces the programmable 5 volt
                 output to zero.
   Bit 9:        Enabies the programmable 12 volt output. Setting both bit 8 and bit 9 together asserts the credit
                 card reset signal. Note: Credit card not inserted or disabled forces the programmable 12 volt
                 output to zero.

   Bit 10:       Enables a mode where the credit card WAIT signal is looked at during writes (it is always looked at
                 during reads). In a 68000 this necessitates insterting a wait state. When set to zero, zero wait state
                 cycles are run.
   Bit 11:       Enables 1.2 us memory cycles (instead of the normal 560ns).
   Bits 12 -15: Are for the currently unimplemented credit card page registers. You can tell they are
                unimplemented because they do not read back what is written.
