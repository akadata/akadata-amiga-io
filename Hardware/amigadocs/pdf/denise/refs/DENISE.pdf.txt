    1.0       DESCRIPTION

    This Specification describes the requirements for a Display ENcoder Integrated Circuit (I.C.).

    Main Function:

   •      Display data buffer, encode display object to RGB colors.

   •      Bitplane & Sprite display. Parallel data from data bus is retained in six (6) Bitplane and eight pairs of
          Sprite data buffers.

   •      Bitplane Data loaded and serialized during display activity.

   •      Sprite Data loaded during display inactivity - individual serialization occurs when Sprite position Com-
          pare logic detects equality between the Sync Counter and any Sprite Position Register.

   •      Six (6) lines of Bitplane & eight (8) pairs of serial data go to Priority control logic which selects only one
          (1) of the Sprites or one (1) of the separate Bitmap images to produce the five (5) bit color select code at
          its’ output. This five (5) bit code then selects one of the thirty-two (32) color registers to produce the
          twelve (12) bit RGB video output.

   •      The Bitplane and Sprite serial lines also go to the Collision Detect Logic, which detects real time coinci-
          dence between them, and sets appropriate bits in the Collision Storage register. This register is read and
          cleared by the 68000.

   •      The four (4) "mouse counters" are controlled by the two (2) mouse-joystick connectors. These count the
          pulses representing the horizontal and vertical motion of two (2) "mouse" controllers, and are read by the
          68000.
