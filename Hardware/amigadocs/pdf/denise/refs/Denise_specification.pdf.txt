1.1       GENERAL DESCRIPTION

      This Specification describes the requirements for a
      Display ENcoder Integrated Circuit (I.C.).

      Main Function:    display data buffer,
                  encode display object to RGB colors.

                 Bitplane & Sprite display.
                 Parallel data from data bus is
                 retained in six (6) Bitplane and eight
                 pairs of Sprite data buffers.

                 Bitplane Data loaded and serialized
                 during display activity.

                 Sprite Data loaded during display
                 inactivity - individual serialization
                 occurs when Sprite position Compare
                 logic detects equality between the
                 Sync Counter and any Sprite Position
                 Register.

                 Six (6) lines of Bitplane & eight (8)
                 pairs of serial data go to Priority
                 control logic which selects only one
                 (1) of the Sprites or one (1) of the
                 separate Bitmap images to produce the
                 five (5) bit color select code at its'
                 output.   This five (5) bit code then
                 selects one of the thirty-two (32)
                 color registers to produce the twelve
                 (12) bit RGB video output.

                 The Bitplane and Sprite serial lines
                 also go to the Collision Detect Logic,
                 which detects real time coincidence
                 between them, and sets appropriate
                 bits in the Collision Storage register.
                 This register is read and cleared by the
                 68000.

                 The four (4) "mouse counters" are
                 controlled by the two (2) mouse-joystick
                 connectors. These count the pulses
                 representing the horizontal and vertical
                 motion of two (2) "mouse" controllers,
                 and are read by the 68000.

                             receive the DMA data
                             fetched from RAM by the
                             Bit Plane address
                             pointers. They may also
                             be written by either
                             micro. They act as a 6

                             The parallel to serial
                             conversion is triggered
                             whenever bit plane #1 is
                             written, indicating the
                             transmission of all bit

                             therefore always on the

    x= don't care; but drive to 0 for upward compatibility !
y= register bits contained in AGNUS, not defined here.

    HIRES=High resolution(640*200/640*400interlace) mode
    BPU =Bit plane use code 000-110 (NONE thru 6 inclusive)
    HAM=Hold and Modify mode
    DPF=Double playfield (PF1=odd PF2=even bit planes)
      not available in SHRES mode, although priority and
      scrolling for the BP1 & 2 are separate.
     (If BPU=6 and HAM=0 and DPF=0 a special mode is defined that
     allows bitplane 6 to cause an intensity reduction of the other
     5 bitplanes. The color register output selected by 5 bitplanes
     is shifted to half intensity by the 6th bitplane. This is
 called EXTRA-HALFBRITE Mode.
    COLOR= Composite video COLOR enable
    GAUD=Genlock audio enable. This level appears on the
      ZD pin on Denise during all blanking periods.
SHRES= Super-hi-res mode, 35nS pixel width
    ENBPLCN3= When set enables all the new features in BPLCON3;
 when reset Denise returns to normal operation
    PF2Hx= Playfield 2 horizontal scroll code
    PF1Hx= Playfield 1 horizontal scroll code
     Scroll LSB is 1 pixel @ low res, 2 at HRES, 4 @ SHRES
ZDBPSELx= 3 bit field which selects which Bit plane is to be
 used for ZD when ZDBBPEN is set;000 selects BP1 and 101
 selects BP6. 110 & 111 are reserved for future use.
ZDBPEN= causes ZD pin to mirror bitplane selected by
 ZDBPSELx bits. This does not disable the ZD mode defined by
 ZDCTEN, but rather is "ored" with it.
ZDCTEN= causes ZD pin to mirror bit #15 of the
 active color table entry;for SHRES mode bit #14 needs to be
 set to the same value as bit #15 in each color table entry.
 When ZDCTEN is reset ZD reverts to mirroring color(0).
KILLEHB= disables Extra Half Brite mode.
PF2PRI= gives Playfield 2 priority over Playfield 1.
    PF2Px= Playfield 2 priority code (with resp. to sprites)
    PF1Px= Playfield 1 priority code (with resp. to sprites)
BRDRBLNK= "border area" is blanked instead of color(0).
BRDNTRAN= "border area" is non-transparent(ZD pin is low
 when border is displayed.
ZDCLKEN= ZD pin outputs a 14MHZ clock whose falling edge
 coincides with high-res(7MHZ) video data. This bit when
 set disables all other ZD functions.
    EXTBLKEN= CBL* pin on Denise supplies blanking instead
         of the internal fixed decodes. This pin comes from the
         CSY* pin of Agnus, and if BLANKEN is set there (BEAMCON0)
         as well, the variable blanking will be used in Denise.

CLXCON     098        W     Collision Control This register
                      controls which Bitplanes are
                      included (enabled) in collision
                      detection, and their required
                      state if included. It also
                      controls the individual inclusion
                      of odd numbered sprites in the
                      collision detection, by logically
                      OR-ing them with their
                      corresponding even numbered
                      sprite.

  COLORxx   180-1BE           W     COLOR table xx
            There are thirty-two (32) of these registers
            (xx=00-31) and they are sometimes collectively
            called the "Color Palette". They contain 12
            bit codes representing RED, GREEN, BLUE colors
            for RGB systems. One of these registers at a
            time is selected (by the BPLxDAT serialized
            video code). The Table below shows the
            color register bit usage.

  BIT #     15,14,13,12, 11,10,09,08, 07,06,05,04, 03,02,01,00
      -----------   -----------  -----------  -----------

  T = TRANSPARENCY    R = RED       G = GREEN     B = BLUE    X = UNUSED

  T1 of COLOR00 thru COLOR31 sets ZD pin HI when color is selected
in all video modes. In super-hi-res mode T2 sets ZD pin HI as well
(Bit #14 is unused in modes other than super-hi-res).

DENISEID 07C            R     Denise revision level
            The early Denise revision levels do not have this
            register, so whatever was previously written to the
            data bus on the previous access will still be there
            during this read cycle. Current revs(8373Rx) return
            hex(FC) while prototype 8369Rx returned hex(FE).

  DIWHIGH   1E4         W     Display Window upper bits - start/stop
            This is an added register for the HIRES chips, allows
            larger start & stop ranges. If it is not written,
            DIWSTART/DIWSTOP supply all bits required for start &
            stop values. If it is written subsequent to DIWSTART
            or DIWSTOP then it provides additional horizontal bits:

             These address each read a pair of 8 bit mouse
             counters. 0=left controller pair, 1=right
             controller pair, (4 counters total). The bit
             usage for both left and right addresses is
             shown below. Each counter is clocked by signals
             from 2 controller pins. Bits 1 and 0 of each
             counter may be read to determine the state of
             these 2 clock pins. This allows these pins to
             double as joystick switch inputs.

             The following Table shows the Mouse/Joystick
             connector pin usage. The pins (and their
             functions) are sampled (multiplexed) into
             the DENISE chip during the clock times shown
             in the Table. This Table is for reference only,
             and should not be needed by the programmer.
             NOTE: The joystick functions are all "active
             low" at the connector pins.

             After being sampled, these Connector Pin signals
             are used in quadrature to clock the Mouse
             Counters. The LEFT and RIGHT joystick functions
             (active high) are directly available on the Y1
             and X1 bits of each counter. In order to
             recreate the FORWARD and BACK joystick functions;
             however, it is necessary to logically combine
             (exclusive OR) the lower two bits of each
             counter. This is illustrated in the following
             table.

                These registers buffer the Sprite image
                data. They are usually loaded by either
                processor at any time. When a horizontal
                comparison occurs the buffers are dumped
                into shift registers and serially
                outputted to the display, MSB first on
                the left. NOTE: Writing to the A buffer
                enables (arms) the sprite. Writing to
                the SPRxCTL register disables the Sprite.
                If enabled, data in the A and B buffers
                will be outputted whenever the beam
                counter equals the Sprite horizontal
                position value in the SPRxPOS register.

               strobe shown above is used during the
               second refresh time slot of every other
               line, to identify lines with long counts
               (228). There are 4 refresh time slots,
               and any not used for strobes will leave a
               null (FF) address on the dest. addr. bus.
